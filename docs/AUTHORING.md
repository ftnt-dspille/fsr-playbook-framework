# Authoring playbooks in YAML

## Quick orientation

```
fsrpb compile in.yaml -o out.json    # YAML → JSON (offline)
fsrpb validate in.yaml               # check refs, "did you mean…"
fsrpb push in.yaml                   # deploy to appliance
fsrpb pull <name|uuid>               # fetch a live playbook as YAML
fsrpb diff in.yaml                   # local YAML vs live
fsrpb run-op <connector> <op>        # fire a single connector op
fsrpb run-playbook <name|uuid>       # trigger a deployed playbook
fsrpb explain {connector|step|filter|module|recipe} <name>
```

## Top-level shape

```yaml
collection: My Collection
description: optional
visible: true

playbooks:
  - name: Unique Name
    description: optional
    tag: optional
    is_active: true                    # default true; set false for a disabled draft
    owners: [TeamA, TeamB]            # restrict who can run it (optional)
    parameters: [hostname, severity]  # input params; read as vars.input.params.<name>
    steps:
      - name: Start
        type: start
        next: Do Lookup
      - name: Do Lookup
        type: connector
        connector: virustotal
        operation: query_ip
        params:
          ip: "{{ vars.input.params.hostname }}"
        next: Done
      - name: Done
        type: end
    annotations:                      # optional canvas notes/blocks
      - id: setup_phase
        kind: block
        title: Setup
        contains: [Start, Do Lookup]
```

**Rules:**
- `collection` name must be globally unique on the appliance
- `name` must be unique within a collection
- Each playbook needs exactly one trigger step (`start`, `start_on_create`, `start_on_update`, `start_on_delete`, or `api_endpoint`)
- Steps are identified by `name:` (not `id:`). Use `name:` in `next:` and `branches:` references.

## Step types

| `type:` | Description | Key arguments |
|---|---|---|
| `start` | Manual trigger (Run button). Add `module:` to make it a record-action trigger. | `module`, `button_label`, `requires_record`, `run_mode` |
| `start_on_create` | Fires when a record is created. | `module`, `when: {logic, filters: [{field, op, value}]}` |
| `start_on_update` | Fires when a record is updated. | `module`, `when: …` (supports `op: changed`) |
| `start_on_delete` | Fires when a record is deleted. | `module`, `when: …` |
| `api_endpoint` | Exposes the playbook as an HTTP endpoint. | `route`, `authentication_methods` (optional, defaults to token) |
| `set_variable` | Sets variables for downstream use. | `vars: {name: value, …}` |
| `decision` | Branches based on conditions. | `conditions: [{display, when, next}]`, `default: <step>` |
| `connector` | Calls a connector operation. | `connector`, `operation`, `params`, `config` |
| `find_record` | Queries records from a module. | `module`, `filters: [{field, operator, value}]`, `limit`, `logic`, `sort`, `select`, `relationships`, `max_relations` |
| `create_record` | Creates a new record. | `module` (required), `fields: {field: value}`, `operation`, `is_upsert`, `on_conflict`, `update_fields` |
| `update_record` | Updates an existing record. | `record` (IRI), `module` (required), `fields: {field: value}`, `link:`/`unlink: {rel: [uuid]}` (append/detach), `operation` |
| `delete_record` | Deletes a record. | `record:`, or `module:` + `record_id:`, or `module:` + `query: {logic, filters}` (bulk); `show_deleted:` |
| `manual_input` | Pauses for human input (form or buttons). | `title`, `description`, `options`, `inputs`, `email`, `assign_to`, `is_approval` |
| `delay` | Waits for a duration or event. | `seconds` (or `minutes`/`hours`/`days`) |
| `code_snippet` | Runs inline Python. | `code: \|...`, `config` (optional) |
| `send_email` | Sends an email. | `to`, `subject`, `body`, `from`, `cc`, `bcc` |
| `approval` | Creates an approval request. | `resource: {assignedTo, owners, userOwners, approvaldescription}`, `timeout` |
| `create_task` | Creates a manual task. | `resource: {name, status, priority, …}` |
| `set_api_keys` | Sets API keys for the appliance. | `public_key`, `private_key` |
| `workflow_reference` | Calls another playbook in the same collection. | `target` (name) or `workflowReference` (IRI), `arguments` |
| `stop` / `end` | Terminal step (no-op). | (none) |
| `utilities` | No-op utility step. | (none) |
| `ingest_bulk_feed` | Bulk-ingest records via a feed. | `module`, `fields`, `feed_config` |

## Universal step keys

These keys can be added to any step:

```yaml
- name: Block IP
  type: connector
  when: "{{ vars.score > 70 }}"                        # conditional execution
  retry: {times: 3, delay: 5, until: "{{ vars.done }}"} # retry loop
  ignore_errors: true                                  # continue on failure
  apply_async: true                                     # fire-and-forget
  on_remote: pick_from_record                            # route to remote agent
  for_each: {item: "{{ vars.ips }}"}                   # loop over a list
  mock_result: {data: {score: 0}}                       # mock output for testing
  set: {last_lookup_at: "{{ now() }}"}                  # stamp vars after step
  with:                                                  # alias deep Jinja paths
    info: "{{ vars.steps.Enrich.data.code_output }}"
  post_comment: "auto-added by triage"                   # post a comment on the record
  comment: "blocks egress to the C2 IP"                  # canvas sticky-note
  description: "Free-form detail pane text"              # step description
```

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `when:` | Jinja boolean -- the step runs only when truthy. On `start_on_create`/`start_on_update`: a field-based trigger filter (`{logic, filters: [{field, op, value}]}`). |
| `retry:` | Retry the step until a condition holds. Keys: `times`, `delay` (seconds), `until` (Jinja condition). |
| `ignore_errors:` | Boolean. When `true`, a step failure doesn't halt the playbook. |
| `apply_async:` | Boolean. Fire-and-forget execution. |
| `on_remote:` | Route execution to a remote/tenant agent. `pick_from_record` or an agent name. |
| `for_each:` | Loop the step over a list. See [Looping](#looping-a-step-over-a-list-for_each). |
| `mock_result:` | The payload `--mock` runs return for this step. Returned verbatim -- connector/code_snippet steps with `mock_result` skip the `{data, status, message}` envelope, so downstream `.data` refs render empty in mock mode. Shape `mock_result` to match the real output (or include a top-level `data:` key if you want `.data` refs to work in mock). |
| `set:` | Inline vars stamped after the step runs. Read as `vars.<name>` downstream. |
| `with:` | Jinja path binding -- alias a long `vars.steps.X.data.Y` path for the step's scope. See [with: binding](#with-jinja-path-binding). |
| `post_comment:` | Post a collaboration comment to the record. Sugar for `message: {content: "…"}`. |
| `comment:` | A canvas sticky-note for humans; does not affect execution. |
| `description:` | Free-form text shown in the step's detail pane. |

### `with:` -- Jinja path binding

When a step references the same deep Jinja path many times, `with:`
aliases it for the step's scope:

```yaml
- name: FMG Ensure Vendor Address
  type: connector
  with:
    info: "{{ vars.steps.Enrich_Host.data.code_output }}"
  connector: fortinet-fortimanager-json-rpc
  operation: get_address
  params:
    url: "/pm/config/adom/{{ vars.info.adom }}/obj/firewall/address/{{ vars.info.src_addr_name }}"
```

- Binding names must be valid identifiers (letter/underscore start).
- Values can be `{{ }}`-wrapped or bare Jinja expressions.
- Word-boundary matching: `vars.info` matches in `{{ vars.info.adom }}`
  but **not** in `{{ vars.information }}`.

### `message:` -- posting a comment to the record

Works on any step type except `delay` and `set_api_keys`:

```yaml
- name: Block IP
  type: connector
  message:
    content: "Blocked {{ vars.src_ip }} on FortiGate."
    record: "{{ vars.input.records[0]['@id'] }}"   # omit when triggered on a record
    tags: [containment]                             # optional
    thread: false                                   # optional, default false
  connector: fortigate-firewall
  operation: block_ip
  params: {ip: "{{ vars.src_ip }}"}
```

**`record:` is required for `--mock` and API-triggered runs.** When
omitted, FSR defaults to the trigger record
(`vars.input.records[0]`). This is correct for record-triggered
playbooks but fails with "No record found" in `--mock` runs (which use
`notrigger` mode) and manual/API-triggered runs without a record.
Always set `record:` explicitly, or use `set:`/`vars:` instead of
`message:` for mock-friendly output.

## Variables and Jinja

| Expression | What it gives you |
|---|---|
| `{{ vars.input.records[0] }}` | the trigger record |
| `{{ vars.input.params.<name> }}` | input param declared in `parameters:` |
| `{{ vars.steps.<step_name>.<field> }}` | output of a previous step (name with spaces → underscores) |
| `{{ vars.<name> }}` | a variable set via `set_variable` or `set:` |
| `{{ vars.env.<key> }}` | env-level variables (organization, user, …) |
| `{{ vars.item }}` | current element in a `for_each` loop |

### Reading a previous step's output

The `vars.steps.<key>` namespace uses the step's **name** with spaces
converted to underscores (case preserved):

```yaml
- name: Get organization
  type: connector
  connector: fortinet-fortisiem
  operation: get_org_name_by_org_id
  next: Route

- name: Route
  type: decision
  conditions:
    - display: found
      when: "{{ vars.steps.Get_organization.records[0].id is defined }}"
      next: Take Action
```

### Per-step-type output shapes

| Step type | Where the output lands |
|---|---|
| `connector` | `vars.steps.<name>.data` (or `.records` per op output schema) |
| `find_record` | `vars.steps.<name>.records[]` (each is a full module record) |
| `set_variable` | variables go directly to `vars.<var_name>` (not under `vars.steps`) |
| `manual_input` | `vars.steps.<name>.input.<field>` (after the operator submits) |
| `code_snippet` | `return` value, at `vars.steps.<name>.data.code_output` |
| `workflow_reference` | child's **last step** result at `vars.steps.<name>.<key>` |

### Setting variables

**On a `set_variable` step** -- use `vars:` at the step level:

```yaml
- name: Capture
  type: set_variable
  vars:
    severity_label: "{{ vars.input.records[0].severity }}"
    indicator_count: "{{ vars.steps.Fetch.indicators | length }}"
    next_action: "escalate"
```

**On any other step** -- use `set:` to stamp vars after the step runs:

```yaml
- name: Fetch
  type: connector
  connector: my-connector
  operation: list_things
  params:
    since: "{{ vars.lastPullTime }}"
  set:
    fetched_at: "{{ now() }}"
    pull_window: "{{ vars.lastPullTime }}"
```

## Routing

**Linear flow** -- one step → next:

```yaml
- name: Step A
  type: set_variable
  vars: {x: 1}
  next: Step B
- name: Step B
  type: end
```

**Branching** -- a decision routes to N possibilities:

```yaml
- name: Branch
  type: decision
  conditions:
    - display: yes
      when: "{{ vars.severity == 'high' }}"
      next: Escalate
    - display: no
      when: "{{ vars.severity != 'high' }}"
      next: Log Only
  default: Log Only           # optional implicit else
```

**Fanout** -- run multiple steps concurrently with a list `next:`:

```yaml
- name: Split
  type: set_variable
  next: [Path A, Path B]      # both run; no condition needed
- name: Path A
  type: set_variable
  vars: {path_a_value: from_a}
  next: Merge
- name: Path B
  type: set_variable
  vars: {path_b_value: from_b}
  next: Merge
- name: Merge
  type: code_snippet          # sees BOTH vars.path_a_value and vars.path_b_value
```

`next: [A, B]` is sugar for `unlabeled_next:`. FSR runs all targets
concurrently, and variables from **all** paths are available at the merge
point and even mid-path on sibling chains (live-verified on 8.0.0). This
is unlike `decision`/`manual_input` branches, where only one path runs
and the other's variables are empty.

**Manual input branching** -- each option routes to a different step:

```yaml
- name: Approve Action?
  type: manual_input
  title: Approve blocking?
  options:
    - display: Approve
      primary: true
      next: Block IP
    - display: Reject
      next: End
```

## Looping a step over a list (`for_each`)

Any step can run once per element of a list:

```yaml
- name: Create Alerts
  type: create_record
  module: alerts
  fields:
    name: "{{ vars.item.name }}"
    severity: "{{ vars.item.severity | default('Medium') }}"
  for_each:
    item: "{{ vars.steps.fetch.records }}"   # required: Jinja list expression
    parallel: false                           # optional, default false
    condition: ""                             # optional Jinja filter
    max_parallel: 5                           # optional; cap concurrent iterations
    # __bulk: true                             # bypass on-create triggers (high-volume feeds)
    # batch_size: 100                          # only with __bulk
    # break_loop: ""                            # optional; truthy stops the loop
```

- `for_each.item` is **required** and must evaluate to a list.
- The current element is always `vars.item` (object items expose fields as `vars.item.<field>`).
- `parallel: true` runs iterations concurrently -- only safe with no shared state.
- `__bulk: true` bypasses on-create/on-update playbook triggers. Use for high-volume feeds only.

## Step type details

### `connector`

```yaml
- name: Lookup IP
  type: connector
  connector: virustotal           # required
  operation: query_ip            # required
  config: "my-vt-config"         # config name or UUID; omit for default
  params:
    ip: "{{ vars.input.params.hostname }}"
```

### `find_record`

```yaml
- name: Find Alert
  type: find_record
  module: alerts
  filters:
    - field: severity
      operator: eq
      value: High
  limit: 200                      # see note below -- rides on the module
  logic: AND
  sort:                           # optional
    - field: createDate
      direction: DESC             # ASC (default) | DESC
  select: [name, status]          # optional field projection
  relationships: true             # optional; include related records
  max_relations: 100              # optional; cap per relationship
  partial: true                   # optional; return first page only
```

**`limit:` is emitted onto the module, not just the query.** The compiler
writes `module: alerts?$limit=200` alongside `query.limit`, because the
platform reads the page size from the query string and ignores the body value.
Authored as above this is handled for you -- but if you hand-write a raw
`query:` envelope with only `limit` inside it, the step silently returns **30
rows** and reports success. Every shipped Solution Pack find step carries the
suffix.

`max_relations:` becomes `$fsr_max_relation_count=N` and only bites alongside
`relationships: true`. Worth setting: expanding relationships uncapped on a
busy module can pull an unbounded child set.

### `create_record` / `update_record`

`module:` is **required** on both.

```yaml
- name: Create Alert
  type: create_record
  module: alerts
  fields:
    name: "Suspicious IP detected"
    severity: High
  operation: Overwrite
  is_upsert: false                # optional
  on_conflict: update_all         # optional -- see below

- name: Update Alert
  type: update_record
  record: "{{ vars.steps.Find.records[0]['@id'] }}"
  module: alerts
  fields:
    status: Investigating
    description: "Updated by triage playbook"
  operation: Replace
```

#### What happens when the record already exists (`on_conflict:`)

An upsert is a **PUT**: every field in the payload overwrites, so a field this
run could not fetch is not left alone, it is **erased**. If NVD is unreachable,
an empty description replaces a good one; if only some sources carry a vendor,
every other source blanks it on arrival.

`on_conflict:` settles that. It is the step editor's "Uniqueness conflict
settings", and it compiles to `__replace` / `__fieldsToUpdate` inside the
`resource` payload:

| `on_conflict:` | when the record already exists |
|---|---|
| `fail` | the collision **fails the step** and halts the run |
| `keep_existing` | the existing record is left untouched |
| `update_all` | every field in `fields:` overwrites |
| `update_listed` | only the fields named in `update_fields:` are written |

```yaml
- name: Upsert CVE
  type: create_record
  module: c_v_es
  update_fields: [cVSSv3, ePSSScore]   # implies on_conflict: update_listed
  fields:
    cVEID: "CVE-2024-0001"
    description: "..."                 # NOT in update_fields -> preserved
    cVSSv3: "9.8"                      # listed -> refreshed
```

`update_fields:` on its own implies `on_conflict: update_listed`; naming the
fields is the intent. It may be an **interpolation** rather than a literal
list, which is usually what you want -- it lets the set mean "the fields this
run actually filled" instead of a fixed author-time allowlist:

```yaml
  update_fields: "{{ vars.item.updatable }}"
```

Three things measured on 8.0, each case run twice (once with no record present,
once against a seeded one):

* **`fail` is a different endpoint, not a setting.** It keeps the step on the
  plain `/api/3/<module>` collection, where a duplicate is a real 409. The other
  three route at `/api/3/upsert/<module>`, which is where `__replace` is read at
  all -- it is ignored outright on the plain endpoint.
* **Omitting the key is not `fail`.** A bare `is_upsert: true` with no
  `on_conflict:` **overwrites everything**. That is the destructive default this
  key exists to make explicit.
* **No setting prevents the initial create**, and none produced a duplicate.

`on_conflict:` is rejected on `update_record`, which already targets one record
by IRI and so has no uniqueness conflict to settle.

#### An upsert needs the module's natural key in the payload

An upsert reconciles duplicates by the module's **unique constraint** --
`sourceId` on alerts and incidents, `value` + `typeofindicator` on indicators,
`cVEID` on CVEs. If the payload does not set those columns there is nothing to
match on, so the step **inserts a new record on every run**:

```yaml
- name: Upsert alert            # WRONG -- a new alert every run
  type: create_record
  module: alerts
  is_upsert: true
  fields:
    name: "test alert"          # `sourceId` never set
```

This is worth knowing because of how it presents. Nothing errors, the run is
green, and each run's record holds whatever that run wrote -- so from the
outside it reads as "the update isn't applying" or "tags aren't appending",
which sends you looking at merge semantics rather than at a field that is not
there. The compiler warns when it can see the constraint:

> upsert on `alerts` does not set 'sourceId' -- the column(s) it matches
> duplicates on. With no natural key in the payload it inserts a NEW record on
> every run instead of updating.

It is a **warning**, not an error: the column may be filled by a Jinja value
the compiler cannot evaluate. It stays silent when the catalog has no
constraint recorded for the module, so an unwarmed catalog says nothing rather
than guessing.

#### Writing a multi-value field REPLACES it

A `fields:` write to a collection field (`recordTags`, `indicators`, `assets`,
any relationship) **discards whatever was already there**. To add without
disturbing existing values, use `link:`:

```yaml
- name: Attach indicator
  type: update_record
  module: alerts
  record: "{{ vars.item['@id'] }}"
  link:                           # appends -- compiles to resource.__link
    indicators: ["{{ vars.new_indicator_uuid }}"]
  fields:                         # scalars can be written in the same step
    status: /api/3/picklists/...
```

Measured on live 7.x and 8.0 appliances: seeding an alert with 2 indicators and
writing 1 via `fields:` leaves **1**; linking 1 via `link:` leaves **3**, with
unrelated tags untouched. `__link` is the same primitive the platform's own
escalation engine uses to attach alerts and assets to a case.

**`operation:` / `field_operations:` / `tags_operation:` do NOT control this.**
They map to the wire keys `operation` / `fieldOperation` / `tagsOperation`,
which 349 of 370 live update steps set -- but 15 combinations were tested across
both versions and both field types (`Append`, `Overwrite`, `Replace`,
per-field overrides, `OverwriteTags`, `AppendTags`, and omitting them entirely)
and **every one replaced the collection**. The keys are accepted for wire
fidelity -- and the compiler now emits a **warning** when you set them -- but
do not rely on them to preserve data. Use `link:`.

Re-measured on 8.0 on the upsert path as well, since that is where the UI's
Tags Overwrite/Append control lives: `field_operations` Append, `Overwrite`,
naming `recordTags` in `update_fields:`, and setting no key at all **all**
replaced the tag list, including with `on_conflict: update_all`. Only `link:`
appended. `update_fields:` protects scalar fields; it does not make a `fields:`
write to a collection additive.

To REMOVE a related record, use `unlink:` -- the same primitive in reverse
(measured: 2 linked indicators, unlink 1, leaves 1):

```yaml
- name: Detach indicator
  type: update_record
  module: alerts
  record: "{{ vars.item['@id'] }}"
  unlink:
    indicators: ["<uuid>"]
  fields:
    description: written in the same step
```

`link:` and `unlink:` can appear in one step -- both ride in the same `resource`
payload, so attaching and detaching is a single PUT, not two steps. The wire
keys (`__link` / `__unlink`) are still accepted under `fields:` if you prefer
to write them out.

Reach for `unlink:` rather than rewriting the collection by hand: detaching via
`fields:` means reading the current list, dropping one entry and writing the
rest back, which races anything else touching that record and silently discards
the difference if the read comes back short.

### `delete_record`

```yaml
- name: Delete Record
  type: delete_record
  record: "{{ vars.steps.Find.records[0]['@id'] }}"
  # or by module + ID:
  # module: alerts
  # record_id: "123"
  # or bulk by filters -- NOTE: these go inside a `query:` envelope on this
  # step (unlike find_record, `filters:`/`logic:` at step level are rejected):
  # module: alerts
  # query:
  #   logic: AND
  #   filters: [{type: primitive, field: status, operator: eq, _operator: eq, value: Closed}]
  show_deleted: false             # optional
```

**Bulk delete is not row-capped** -- 45 matching records were deleted in one
run, with and without a `?$limit=` suffix. Unlike `find_record`, there is no
30-row ceiling to work around.

**A filter the platform rejects deletes nothing and still reports success.** A
raw `contains` filter on `alerts.name` errors server-side on this platform; the
step swallowed it, deleted 0 of 45, and the run finished green. Fail-safe in
direction, but silent -- verify the count after a bulk delete rather than
trusting the run status.

### Substring filters: write `contains`, get `like`

`/api/query/<module>` has no scalar `contains` -- sending one returns a 500, and
so do `startswith` and `sw`. The only substring match it honours is `like` with
an explicit `%` in the value. So on `find_record` and `delete_record` filters
the compiler rewrites for you (with a warning), exactly as it already did for
trigger `when:` conditions:

| authored | compiled |
|---|---|
| `operator: contains`, `value: test` | `operator: like`, `value: %test%` |
| `operator: startswith`, `value: test` | `operator: like`, `value: test%` |
| `operator: endswith`, `value: test` | `operator: like`, `value: %test` |
| `operator: notcontains`, `value: test` | `operator: notlike`, `value: %test%` |

A value you wildcard yourself (`%already%`) is passed through untouched, so you
can still write your own pattern. Both `operator` and `_operator` are set -- the
platform reads the first and the designer reads the second, and a step where
they disagree renders with the wrong operator selected.

### `manual_input`

```yaml
- name: Approve Action?
  type: manual_input
  title: "Approve blocking?"
  description: "Review the alert and choose an action."
  options:
    - display: Approve
      primary: true
      next: Block IP
    - display: Reject
      next: End
  inputs:                          # optional form fields
    - name: comment
      kind: textarea
      label: "Comment"
      required: true
    - name: severity
      kind: select
      label: "Severity"
      options: [Low, Medium, High]
  email:                           # optional email notification
    enabled: true
    subject: "Action required"
    recipients:
      - alice@example.com
    body: "Please review this alert"
  assign_to:                       # optional assignment
    person: "admin"                # or: team: "Tier 1"  or: record_field: true
  is_approval: false               # set true for an approval gate
```

`inputs[]` per-field keys: `name`, `kind`, `label`, `tooltip`, `required`,
`default`, `options`. Supported `kind:` values: `text, textarea, richtext,
html, email, url, password, integer, number, checkbox, boolean, select,
datetime, json`. `kind: select` needs `options:`.

After the operator submits, form fields are read at
`vars.steps.<step_name>.input.<name>`.

### `delay`

```yaml
- name: Wait
  type: delay
  seconds: 30
  # or: minutes: 5  /  hours: 1  /  days: 1
```

### `code_snippet`

```yaml
- name: Run Script
  type: code_snippet
  code: |
    result = {"ip": "{{ vars.input.params.ip }}", "blocked": True}
    return result
  config: "python-runner"    # optional
```

**Sandbox restrictions.** The FSR code-snippet sandbox bans certain
Python names -- accessing them fails at runtime with "Uses of [...] is
restricted". The most common traps:

| Banned name | Why | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `vars` | FSR injects `vars` as a Jinja context object, not a Python variable | use Jinja templates: `x = {{ vars.steps.X.field }}` |
| `set` | `set()` is not bound in the sandbox | use a dict: `seen = {}; seen[k] = True` |
| `isinstance`, `hasattr`, `enumerate` | not bound | use `try/except AttributeError` or a manual index counter |
| `open`, `os`, `sys`, `subprocess` | no filesystem/process access | do I/O via connector steps instead |

**Reading step outputs inside code.** Use Jinja templates to inject
values before Python runs -- the sandbox blocks `vars` as a name, so
`vars.steps.X.field` in Python code fails, but `{{ vars.steps.X.field }}`
is resolved by the template engine first:

```yaml
- name: Parse Result
  type: code_snippet
  code: |
    score = {{ vars.steps.Lookup.data.score | tojson }}
    return {"risk": "high"} if score > 70 else {"risk": "low"}
```

**`| tojson` boolean pitfall.** Applying `| tojson` to a whole step
result (or the `data` envelope, or `vars.input`) produces lowercase
`true`/`false` for boolean fields. The sandbox treats lowercase `true`
as a Python name reference and bans it. Safe patterns:

```yaml
# SAFE -- extract string fields only, then tojson
addresses: "{{ vars.steps.Classify_Results | map(attribute='address') | list | tojson }}"
# SAFE -- reference a specific leaf field
score: "{{ vars.steps.Lookup.data.score | tojson }}"
# DANGEROUS -- whole step result has debug, task_id, and lowercase booleans
data: "{{ vars.steps.Lookup | tojson }}"
```

### `send_email`

```yaml
- name: Notify Team
  type: send_email
  to:
    - alice@example.com
    - bob@example.com
  subject: "Alert: {{ vars.input.records[0].name }}"
  body: "Please review this alert."
  from: soc@example.com        # optional
  cc: [lead@example.com]       # optional
  bcc: []                       # optional
```

### `approval`

```yaml
- name: Get Approval
  type: approval
  resource:
    assignedTo: ["admin"]
    owners: ["TeamA"]
    userOwners: ["analyst@example.com"]
    approvaldescription: "Please approve the containment action."
  timeout:                     # optional
    days: 1
    hours: 0
    minutes: 0
```

### `workflow_reference`

```yaml
- name: Call Child
  type: workflow_reference
  target: Resolve Hostname      # name of another playbook in this collection
  arguments:
    hostname: "{{ vars.input.params.hostname }}"
    dns_server: "8.8.8.8"
  apply_async: false
  pass_input_record: false
```

For cross-collection references, use the IRI directly:
```yaml
  workflowReference: /api/3/workflows/<uuid>
  arguments: {hostname: "fsr-1"}
```

**Output = the child's last step result.** The parent reads the
**terminal step's** result at `vars.steps.<parent_step_name>.<key>`. If
the child ends with `end` or `stop`, the result is `{data: null}` -- no
data flows back. To export data, make the child's last step a
`set_variable`:

```yaml
# child playbook -- last step exports data
- name: Export Result
  type: set_variable
  vars:
    address: "{{ vars.steps.Lookup.data.address }}"
    priority: "{{ vars.steps.Classify.data.priority }}"
```

The parent then reads `vars.steps.Call_Child.address`,
`vars.steps.Call_Child.priority`, etc. A `workflow_reference` with
`for_each` does NOT accumulate child results into a list -- read
`vars.steps.<step>` directly (it is already a list of child results)
and extract fields with `map(attribute='field') | list | tojson`.

#### Looping a child playbook (when `do_until` isn't enough)

`retry:` works on a `workflow_reference`, which is how you poll something that
takes more than one step to observe. `do_until` loops a SINGLE step, so a wait
that needs a *pair* -- ask for fresh data, then read it -- has to put the pair
in a child and loop the child:

```yaml
- name: Await Patch
  type: workflow_reference
  target: Refresh And Read Host
  apply_async: false          # required: an async child returns nothing to test
  host_id: "{{ vars.host_id }}"
  retry:
    times: 12
    delay: 15
    until: "{{ vars.steps.Await_Patch.patched == 'yes' }}"
```

**The child must SET the variable, not return it.** The parent reads
`vars.steps.<step>.<var the child set>` -- a `code_output` the child never
promoted to a variable is invisible from the caller, and the `until:` then
never resolves. It does not fail loudly: the loop burns its whole budget on
every run, including the successful ones, and the step still reports success.
So the child ends in a `set_variable`:

```yaml
- name: Answer                # last step of the child
  type: set_variable
  vars:
    patched: "{{ vars.steps.Check_Version.data.code_output.patched }}"
```

Live-verified on 8.0.0: with the child setting `patched: "no"` the parent ran
the full budget; with `"yes"` it stopped after one call.

### `api_endpoint`

```yaml
- name: Start
  type: api_endpoint
  route: lookup_ip              # → /api/triggers/1/lookup_ip
```

Defaults to token-based authentication. To use a different auth mode:
```yaml
  authentication_methods: ["anonymous"]   # No Authentication
  # or
  authentication_methods: ["Basic"]      # HTTP Basic
```

The inbound HTTP body and query params are available at
`vars.steps.<step_name>.input.params.api_body` and `.api_params`.

### `create_task`

```yaml
- name: Create Task
  type: create_task
  resource:
    name: "Review suspicious IP"
    status: "Open"
    priority: "High"
```

### `set_api_keys`

```yaml
- name: Set Keys
  type: set_api_keys
  public_key: "{{ vars.env.API_PUBLIC_KEY }}"
  private_key: "{{ vars.env.API_PRIVATE_KEY }}"
```

## Playbook ownership

By default a playbook is public -- any team can run it. Restrict it:

```yaml
playbooks:
  - name: Lookup IP
    owners: ["TeamA", "TeamB"]
    steps: [...]
```

`owners:` accepts team names (resolved to IRIs via the warmed reference
table) or full team IRIs. An unknown team name is a hard error with a
suggestion.

## Picklist values

Picklist-typed fields accept the friendly display value directly:

```yaml
fields:
  severity: High           # not a picklist IRI
  status: Investigating
  type: Phishing
```

## Comments and annotations

**`comment:`** -- sticky-note explaining a single step:
```yaml
- name: Find Alert
  type: find_record
  comment: |
    Pulls the matching alert before we mutate it.
  module: alerts
  filters: [{field: uuid, operator: eq, value: "{{ vars.input.params.id }}"}]
```

**`annotations:`** -- free-floating notes or grouping blocks:
```yaml
annotations:
  - id: explainer
    kind: note
    title: "Why we re-queue here"
    body: "The async output is checked every minute."
  - id: setup
    kind: block
    title: Setup phase
    contains: [Start, Prep, Lookup]
```

## Common errors

| Code | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `parse_error` | invalid YAML | check indentation |
| `missing_field` | required argument not present | add it; `fsrpb explain step <name>` shows what's required |
| `unknown_step_type` | typo in `type:` | use a name from the step type table |
| `unknown_connector` | typo in connector name | `fsrpb explain connector <name>` to verify |
| `unknown_operation` | op not on the connector | `fsrpb explain connector <name>` lists ops |
| `unknown_param` | param not on the operation | check `fsrpb explain` output |
| `bad_value` | wrong shape, bad Jinja, invalid enum value | message includes specifics |
| `no_trigger` | no trigger step | add exactly one `start`/`start_on_*`/`api_endpoint` |

## Worked examples

All under `examples/` and validated by tests on every commit:

| File | Pattern |
|---|---|
| `hello_connector.yaml` | start → set_variable → connector -- minimum useful playbook |
| `decision_branch.yaml` | start → set_variable → decision → two branches |
| `find_and_update.yaml` | start → find_record → update_record |
| `manual_input_then_act.yaml` | start → manual_input → decision → branched action |
| `parent_calls_child.yaml` | two playbooks; parent invokes child via `target:` with input params |
| `defender_forwarding_triage_collection.yaml` | full collection: parent calls child via `workflow_reference`, grandchild exports data via `set_variable`, parent extracts with `map(attribute=...)` |
